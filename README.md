## Ksquareinc Assassment

## Description
The intent of this coding test is to assess your ability to work with the React framework. We
want you to display your knowledge of software design patterns, as well as your understanding
of best practices in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and responsive web design.

## Requirements
1. Create an input field to hold an id value along with a button, when the button is clicked
it should fetch the post information using the API
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/:id

2. Design a modal component that will display the received from the APIâ€™s response.

3. Allow the user to change the information and display it on the main screen (not in
console.log)
